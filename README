LOGO-MAKER 

In this project I created a logo generator using Node. 
I successfully created a generator for three separate shapes, a square, triangle and a circle. In each 
shape the user can chose different options such as the color and text they wish to render on the page.
I have also included three separate test for each rendering that all pass (run the npm test command to check)
